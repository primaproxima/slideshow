  <h2>Directory Structure</h2>

  <p>
    Directory structure follows _sock drawer_ approach (all files of the same type are grouped together).
    Adding and maintaining files becomes significantly more complicated as number of files in the _drawer_ grows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding/maintaining/removing a feature becomes a nightmare because files are so dispersed.
  </p>

  <p>** Some container components are located in components directory and vice versa.</p>
